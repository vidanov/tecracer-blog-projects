# Enhancing German Search in Amazon OpenSearch Service

**Introduction**

Amazon OpenSearch Service, utilizing the robust OpenSearch framework, excels in search and analytics due to its remarkable speed and efficiency. Despite its strengths, the service’s default configurations might not be fully tailored to address the distinct linguistic challenges encountered in specific languages.

Take German, for example, known for its compound words like “Lebensversicherungsgesellschaft” (life insurance company). Standard tokenization in search technologies treats these compounds as single units, leading to less optimal search results. For improved accuracy, it’s important to index the components of these compounds separately – “Leben” (life), “Versicherung” (insurance), and “Gesellschaft” (company). This approach ensures more precise and effective search outcomes, particularly in languages like German with many compound words.
